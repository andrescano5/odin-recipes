    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided.</li>
        <li>3 (3.5 ounce) links hot Italian sausage, sliced.</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package baby portobello mushrooms, sliced</li>
        <li>1 small onion, diced.</li>
        <li>2 cups vodka marinara sauce.</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground thyme.</li>
        <li>Sea salt and ground black pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package fresh gnocchi.</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon freshly grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    <p>Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add sausage and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove sausage and set aside, leaving residual oil in the pan.</p>

    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    <p>Add mushrooms, onion, and remaining olive oil to the same skillet. Cover and cook over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until cooked down, about 15 minutes. Return sausage to the skillet; add vodka sauce, thyme, salt, and pepper and allow sauce flavors to meld, about 10 minutes.</p>

    <h4>Step 3</h4>
    <p>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook gnocchi in the boiling water until they float to the top, 2 to 4 minutes. Drain and season with salt and pepper.</p>

    <h4>Step 4</h4>
    <p>Serve cooked gnocchi with sauce and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.</p>
